# Abstract

In collaboration with Northeastern Universityâ€™s NeuroLab, headed by Professor Samuel Chung, this project aims to create effective visualizations displaying neuronal regeneration data in Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans). NeuroLab observed a novel form of neuronal regeneration in C. elegans that is independent of common known neuronal regeneration signaling factors. Through the use of an interactive web-based visualization, the goal of this project is to effectively communicate the novel neuronal regeneration data to other researchers and to elucidate key data trends found across the various experimental conditions/groups. The visualization consists of stacked bar charts and dot plots to display the neuronal regeneration data. The linking of the charts enables users to extract key information when examining specific data. Together, the dot plots and the stacked bar charts enable the user to compare novel neuronal regeneration data across the different experimental conditions/groups and to interpret any newly-evident significant data findings.
